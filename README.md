# GET STARTED
#### This is a prototype which can deploy a 1-click Heroku Gun relay. Just css style it to your needs.
## Donate Decentralize
#### Deploy 1-click Heroku Gun relay, instruction for new Heroku users (working)
## Selfhost Decentralize
#### Selfhost in your P2P Browser button (mockup, coming, see https://github.com/HybridWare/hybrid-browser)
#### Selfhost on your own server button (repo and instruction, working)
#### Download Windows Client (replace with your compiled exe from https://github.com/worldpeaceenginelabs/gun-relay-desktop-win, working)
## Drop Support URL (attention)
#### You have to connect the "Drop Support URL" button in the file Component3.svelte with a service of your choice. 

# USE
**Install**: npm install

**Development**: npm run dev

**Build**: npm run build

#### Dont be afraid of Svelte. You can just add the Svelte dependency to your js, react, vue, whatever project and save this template in its own folder, using it as a topbar component, in times when there is need for more gun relays. (Like Wikipedia asks every year for some donation)
